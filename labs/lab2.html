        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          This lab deals with the Artemis Nano Board and its bluetooth
          capabilities. We will go through the connection of the board to our
          computer, as well as sending and receiving texts through Jupyter and
          Python, and end with implementing a notifier to update a global
          variable.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Configurations and Setup
            <p>
              The first part of the lab was setting up our environment and
              installing the required dependencies. Following the steps listed
              on
              <a href="https://cei-lab.github.io/ECE4960-2022/Lab2.html"
                >this page</a
              >, Python3 was installed, a virtual environment for the class was
              created, and the packages used for this lab were successfully
              installed. <br />
              After this, the files provided needed to be edited to reflect the
              correct board, which would be done through the configuration.yaml
              file. Connecting the artemis board to our IDE resulted in the
              serial monitor printing out the correct MAC address, which was
              then inserted into the config file so that our python application
              could communicate with our board. Now that a successful connection
              was established between the Artemis board and the computer, the
              rest of the tasks could be accomplished.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before moving onto the first task, we still need to test out that
              the connection was properly established. Although the connection
              status did correctly print out the MAC addresses for the
              respective devices, we can solidify our assurance by sending and
              receiving basic commands between our two devices. Below is a
              picture of the "Ping" command that would send our board a command,
              and receive back a string.

          </li>
          <li>
            First Task
            <p>
              The first task was a simple echo command. The computer would send
              the echo command with a string, and would receive back the string
              padded with a prefix and a postfix.
            </p>
            <pre>
              <code>
                case ECHO:
                  char char_arr[MAX_MSG_SIZE];
                  // Extract the next value from the command string as a character array
                  success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(char_arr);
                  if (!success)
                      return;
                  tx_estring_value.clear();
                  tx_estring_value.append("ECHO O o ");
                  tx_estring_value.append(char_arr);
                  tx_estring_value.append(" Did you hear that?");
                  tx_characteristic_string.writeValue(tx_estring_value.c_str());
                  Serial.println(tx_estring_value.c_str());
                  
                  break;
              </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
              The code for our echo command was pretty straightforward to
              implement. We initialize a variable that will hold the message
              sent along with the command. We clear our estring to make sure
              that it is properly initialized to be used in our echo command,
              and firstly append our prefix, followed by the message stored in
              our char_arr variable, and finally append a postfix. We set our
              characteristic string to be this new string that we concatenated,
              and also print to the serial monitor to check in real time if the
              code we wrote is correct. On the python side of things, we then
              receive the string that is stored in our tx_characteristic_string
              variable, and print it to the display.

          <li>
            Second Task
            <p>
              The second task was a task that is very similar to an example
              command provided to us. In the example, we would send two ints,
              and in this command, we are going to send three floats. The
              implementation of this command is as follows:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                  case SEND_THREE_FLOATS:
                    float float_a, float_b, float_c;

                    success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(float_a);
                    if (!success)
                        return;
                        
                    success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(float_b);
                    if (!success)
                        return;
                        
                    success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(float_c);
                    if (!success)
                        return;

                    Serial.print("Three floats: ");
                    Serial.print(float_a);
                    Serial.print(", ");
                    Serial.print(float_b);
                    Serial.print(", ");
                    Serial.print(float_c);
                  break;
                </code>
              </pre>
            <p>
              We initialize three float variables, and correctly assign them
              based on the inputs to our command (which is parsed by our
              get_next_value method). We then show that our board has access to
              these threee floats by printing it to the serial monitor.
            </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            Final Task
            <p>
              The final task involves setting up a notification handler to
              receive a float value from the artemis board, and to store that
              float value using a callback function. The implementation was a
              pretty simple task once you know what needs to be done. We
              initialize a global variable, change that variable within a
              function, and call this function whenever our subscribed variable
              changes.
            </p>

          <li>
            Float vs String
            <p>
              As said in the lab handout, there are two ways to receive a float
              value. One is to receive it directly as a BLEFloatCharacteristic
              type in the Arduino side, and the other is to receive a
              BLECStringCharacteristic, and to parse and convert it into a float
              value. Using the receive_float method would be ideal when
              receiving small, individual float values. Converting from a
              bytearray to a float value is efficient and needs no more
              computation. However, when receiving a plethora of different
              values, it becomes more efficient to combine the float values into
              a string on the arduino side and parse the string correctly on the
              computer side.
