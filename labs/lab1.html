        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Lab 1 consisted of the setup and testing of the Artemis Redboard Nano
          as well as the Arduino IDE. Setup includes installing the proper
          applications and packages, and testing includes uploading example
          scripts provided by the Artemis community.

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Download & Installation
            <p>
              The first step of the lab is to install the Arduino IDE onto the
              computer that will be used for the rest of the class. In my case,
              the IDE was installed on a 2018 Macbook Pro running MacOS, so the
              process was as simple as extracting the zip file found on the
              Arduino website and moving the appliation to the corect folder.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Hooking the Artemis Board Up
            <p>
              Next, within the Arduino IDE, the SparkFun Apollo 3 package was
              installed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Blink
            <p>
              The first example used in the testing of the board is a simple
              blinking script. The code is provided by the IDE, and a brief skim
              of what was written showed that the blue LED on the Artemis Nano
              will turn on for one second, then turn off for one second
              repeatedly in a loop. A video can be seen below displaying such
              action
            </p>
            <video class="videos" controls width="400" height="300">
              <source src="./assets/lab1_pt1.mov" />
            </video>
          </li>
          <li>
            Serial Port Printing and testing
            <p>
              The second example used in the testing of the board is its serial
              port. The script provided by the IDE sets a BAUD rate of 115200
              and prints out 10 lines of testing using the printf method, and
              finally tells the user to write into the serial monitor to see the
              script echo it back. The video below shows the initial 10 lines of
              strings being printed, as well as the expected behavior when a
              user types into the input box.
            </p>
            <video class="videos" controls width="400" height="300">

            </video>
          </li>
          <li>
            Analog Read
            <p>
              The third example used in the testing of the board is its analog
              sensors, specifically the temperature sensor. In the script to be
              uploaded onto the board, the program consists of a constant loop
              of analog readings being printed, and the temperature sensor was
              tested by blowing warm air onto it. As the board spent more time
              under the air, the temperature continued to rise and when the
              board was taken away from the source of warm air, the temperature
              readings started to drop, all signals that the sensor is acting
              correctly, and that the code was properly uploaded. Below is a
              video of the changing readings, but as the sensor took a long time
              to reflect a change of temperature the video provided is a bit
              longer than the others.
