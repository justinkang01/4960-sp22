        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          In this lab, we connect two time of flight sensors as well as an IMU
          sensor to our artemis board to retrieve values that we can use in our
          robot.

        <h2>Lab 3A Procedure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Single TOF Sensor
            <p>
              The first thing we had to do is to setup one time of flight sensor
              to the Artemis board so that the communication between the two
              devices can be recognized. After installing the required libraries
              (SparkFun VL53L1X 4m laser distance sensor library), we connect
              the first TOF sensor the our board using the QWIC connector, and
              also leave another wire to allow for daisy chaining.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Finding the Address
            <p>
              Now that the sensor is physically connected, we can test its
              connection via software. By running Example05_Wire_I2C, we can
              print out the address of our sensor. An intersting thing to note
              is that the address printed out is actually not the one documented
              in the datasheet. This can be explained by the fact that the
              address in the datasheet, 0X52, is an 8 bit address, while the
              address read by our artemis is a 7-bit address.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            TOF Modes
            <p>
              There are three modes available for the TOF sensor as stated in
              the datasheet: short, medium, and long. We are also given two
              measurements for the max distance that the sensor can read, one in
              a dark environment and one in a bright environment. If an
              environment is dark, it is best to use the long mode as it
              provides the greatest range, but if an environment is bright, the
              short mode is preferred. For our robot, the short mode is also
              preferred because it will most likely be in a closed, bright
              environment.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Testing both TOF Sensors
            <p>
              We start off connecting only one tof sensor. Using this single
              one, we were able to determine the distance of objects directly in
              front of the sensor. The sensor's distance mode was set to short,
              so the readings we got were pretty accurate to the actual
              distances measured by a measuring tape. Below, you can see three
              images showing the setup of testing a single tof sensor.
            </p>
            <img
              src="assets/one_tof.jpeg"
              alt="single time of flight sensor taped to the back of laptop"
              width="300"
            />
            <img
              src="assets/one_tof2.jpeg"
              alt="another viewe of the time of flight sensor taped to the back of laptop"
              width="300"
            />
            <img
              src="assets/clear_tof.jpeg"
              alt="using a clear object to test the tof sensor"
              width="300"
            />
            <p>
              Then we moved onto testing both time of flight sensors. Because
              the sensors themselves are identical, we need way to distinguish
              the two tof sensors. We do this by taking advantage of the
              shutdown pin on one of the sensors. During startup, we enable the
              shutdown for sensor 1, change the address for sensor 2, then
              reeanble sensor 1 so that now we can clearly identify the two
              sensors. By modifying the example code to include a second tof
              sensor, we can see that it works well, having two different values
              being shown for each individual sensor.
